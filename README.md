## Documentation
This is a Single Page Application. Let's talk about this project. I include functionality that will see more and see fewer job data. You can easily load more data by clicking the see more button. 

When you change the route or move around from one page to another page, the app not will be reloaded. Data will be saved in DB. The user will have to see the Applied job if the user closed the Browser & come back again with the same Browser.
